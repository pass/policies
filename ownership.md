# Who owns a PASS Training & Compliance account?

PASS Training & Compliance accounts are owned and paid for by organizations. When you sign up and create a [PASS Training & Compliance account][home], your organization is the owner of that account and all the data in it. Designated account admins legally representing the owners are the only people who can access all new PASS Training & Compliances created in the account.

PASS Training & Compliance accounts can have multiple admin users. We recommend designating other owners you trust, so that updates can be made to the account when you're not available.

## Designating other people as owners

An account owner can add or remove other owners from the setting section in the account. When you designate someone else as an account owner, they will have the same power to add and remove other owners (including you) at any time.

Adding a new owner to the account (or being removed as an owner) does not remove the payment method from the account. [Please contact support][support] if you’d like to remove the payment information from the account before you add a new owner with the intent of being removed as an owner yourself.

## What happens when none of the current account owners are available?

It happens — people switch jobs, get laid off, go on extended leave — the account owner(s) may be unavailable for any number of reasons. Still, our obligation is to the current account owner(s). That means we’re unable to add new owners to the account without permission from a current account owner, communicated from the email address we have on file.

If the account has been frozen due to non-payment for less than a week, we’ll be glad to thaw the account for a week or so, so people can access their work in the meantime.

The quickest route to add a new owner is often to contact a current account owner, and ask them to log in and add another owner right away from the settings section.

Otherwise, we can also gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file, and request permission to add an owner. If it’s a company address and another employee has access to the inbox, the person who receives the email can grant permission to add a new owner. For security’s sake, permission must come from an address we have on file for a current account owner.

When none of the above is an option, a court order is required to add another owner to the account. We will of course readily comply with any court orders to turn data over to the appropriate party.

## What if I'm a PASS Tools For Service Provider account Owner?
Your clients own their data and accounts in respects to who Owner that account is. Basically we want you to understand to make our policies work we need you to afford the same policies to your clients. If your clients call us and prove they are the owners of their respective account we will give them their data.

## What if I have another question about ownership?

PASS Training & Compliance may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting PASS Training & Compliance [support][support].
