# PASS Training & Compliance SLA
Thousands of companies rely on PASS Training & Compliance. Just like you, PASS Training & Compliance is our company's lifeline. It's where we make decisions, share designs, debate ideas, broadcast companywide announcements, and keep up to date on what everyone's working on. That's why we guarantee 99.99% monthly uptime to teams on PASS Training & Compliance products.

## What is "uptime"?
“Uptime” refers to the period of time when PASS Training & Compliance is up and running.

## How do I find PASS Training & Compliance's uptime?
We make our [uptime public here][uptime].

## What happens if it's below 99.99%?
Our Ops team is working so that we won’t find ourselves in that situation. You can always check up on us [here][uptime]. That is the full limit of our liability under this SLA. Now you can get back to your work with the peace of mind knowing that we’ve got you covered.

## How do we track that uptime?
We track uptime by measuring the server side error rate along with using server monitoring software to look at results from ping tests, web server tests, TCP port tests, and website tests. Any changes to PASS Training & Compliance's uptime are immediately shown on our [Status site][status].

## Will this change in the future?
PASS Training & Compliance may update this SLA once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site.

## What if I have questions about this SLA?
Please get in touch with [support]: https://passtesting.com/support and we’ll be happy to answer them!
