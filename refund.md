# A fair refund policy.

## PASS Tools

You're eligible for a full refund if you cancel your SaaS subscription within 72 hours of purchase. Refunds aren’t available for subscriptions canceled after the time period above.
Refunds are not issued for variable charges. For example, if a SaaS offer bills based on the number of services per month.

Any activities billed under a contract are subject to terms listed in the contract and are not subject to our default refund policy.

## PASS Training 

### Individual Training Courses 
If you purchase a PASS training course, you are not eligible for a refund. If you or a student in your account doesn’t finish their training, you can request that be added to your account as a credit. If you or your student purchases the wrong training type, we can exchange it as long as they have not finished the training. If you or a student in your account finishes the training and a certificate is issued, there is no credit or exchange option.

### Training Subscriptions
You're eligible for a full refund if you cancel your SaaS subscription within 72 hours of purchase as long as no training has been completed and a certificate issued. Refunds aren’t available for subscriptions canceled after the time period above. 

Any activities billed under a contract are subject to terms listed in the contract and are not subject to our default refund policy.
